# TO DO LIST

  * * work out what replacement for `import commands` is in py3, currently put in try block and won't run in py3 (no tests hit this though)
  * work through items marked `#FIXME/zimeon py2-py3 diff` in `tests/test_loader_fixtures.py`. These tests give different results in python2 and python3
