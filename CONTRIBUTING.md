# Contributing to `iiif-prezi`

Issues and pull requests are appreciated.

## Submitting issues

In the case of bugs please describe in detail, preferably with a recipe to repeat and demonstrate the problem. Although you should include test data as necessary, please be careful not to include secrets or confidential information!

If you suggest a new feature, please give an example of expected behavior and use. For changes to modules and methods a test case would be ideal.

## Coding style

If submitting a pull request:

   * Please discuss in a issue before submitting a pull request for significant changes.
   * Follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).
   * Don't repeat code.
   * Cover the code with tests.
